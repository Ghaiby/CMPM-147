                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Infinity: I used the infinite extent of my world to represent a pirate world where ships sail the infinite frontier of the ocean in the hunt of treasures on islands.

                        Variation in Space: As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see fleets of pirate ships roaming different color water and treasure chests hidden on the hearts of the islands. Variations in Key: Different worlds will have different colors of waters, shapes and sizes of islands. The main change is every seed will have waters that have differnt shades from other seeds
                        
                        Signs of Life Clicking tiles causes different pirates to spawn, some are evil some may be good.</p>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used perlin noise to give the water natural patterns of varying colors. Furthermore, the colors of the water are manipulated with each key change to create a whole different ocean. I added logic to generate islands that have fields of grass in the center of them by doing context checks when spawning tiles. Also added a simple algorith for storing a random index with every click used to indicate which type of pirate to spawn.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one was much easier since I'd completed it earlier when I designed the course.</p>
